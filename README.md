 ## Description
 This application was created in order to create a professional “ReadME.md” generator that allows users to input information based on their project. This application is a viable tool to save the user time from constantly having to create “ReadME.md” files time and time again.It will allow users to have a title,description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributions, test, and questions.   This application was created using Node.js with the use of arrow functions, variable scoping, template literals, and modularization.

  Run the following command in the command line to install the required package:
  ~~~

  ## Usage
  To run this application, enter the following command in the command line:

  After typing ‘node index’ into the command line, users will be prompted to multiple questions that the users will then fill out to generate the “ReadME.md”. The values of the answers will then generate a file and organize the sections based on the questions answers ; some sections will have a default answer.
